#!bin/bash
VERSION="1.0.0"
# Author: 	Clark St√ºhmer
# Description:	This script pulls a file from a remote server as a temporary file and opens it.
# Synopsis:
#	sh pull_kdbx-gdrive.sh -i -u -n <GDRIVE DIR> <REMOTE FILEPATH>
# Arguments:
#	-r | --remote
#	The remote provider to use. Valid providers are:
#	gdrive
#	-i | --interactive
#	Prompts the user whether to upload the temporary *.kdbx file back to the
#	remote after closing it, given that the database has been modified.
#	When prompted, "y" simply uploads and overwrites the file,
#	while "Y" additionaly creates a backup of the previous file on the remote.
#	-u | --upload
#	Uploads the file back to the remote server if changes were made
#	and overwrites the previous revision after creating a backup on the remote.
#	This overwrites the -i flag.
#	-n | --no-backup
#	Forces this script to not create a backup on the remote when "-u" is specified.
#	-c
#	Command to execute when opening the file.
